Recently I was in a conversation with someone who was in support of compulsory schooling . We'll call her Sam. The reason Sam gave for this is that, at an earlier age, she was helpfully pulled out of a terrible school by her mother. Her life since has taken a drastically different path and she is now on a fantastic path, and she accredits her victory now to that harsh choice by her mum, one that at the time she vehemently disagreed with. 

# Cases for subtracting freedom

If we look at this example on an indivual level, we can see it as a good thing. It could perhaps be likened to being forced to stop taking heroine. Heroine is so monumentally harmful to the person that takes it, and so very addicting, that if a person begs to be kept on it as we try to wean them off, it is probably safe to ignore them. Their valuations have been hijacked, and their life is at stake. In situations like these, and *only* like these, is the restriction of freedom justified. 


To recap, the only two situations when restrictions in freedom are justified are:
1. If lives are at stake AND
2. A person's valuations have been overtly hijacked


This is clear cut in the heroine case. When on addictive drugs, a person's brain chemistry is literally, physically rewired to crave the drug. 


# Does Sam's case justify the removal of freedom?

1. Was Sam's life at stake?

Sam lived in a poor area. To her parents, if Sam hadn't done better than them and escaped, her life would've been wasted.

*But her life was not at stake.*

The [[Hedonic Treadmill]] is a convenient thing that ensures no matter what that however Sam's life ended up, it is overwhemlingly likely she would end up with the same amount of net happiness over time. And happiness over time is, surely, how we measure the value of a life, right?

Sam is now very driven to help contribute to the world and help others, a value that is important to me. But people should be free to not help other people. Just because my values are my own, does not mean they are intristically more valuable, and I can't push them on others — I can't limit their *freedom* — unless their life is at stake and their valuations have been corrupted.

Perhaps Sam's mother saw a life in poverty as one that was destined to unhappiness, forgetting about the hedonic treadmill



2. Were Sam's values overtly corrupted?

Sam stated to me that the main reason she wanted to stay is because of her friends. And she fought *hard* to stay with her friends. She was not doing marvellously in school, getting mostly C's and D's, but she cared about her friends. Those were her values.

Relative to what her mother cared about, Sam's values were wrong.

Relative to future-Sam, young-Sam's values were wrong.

But there was nothing *overtly, inherently* wrong about Sam's change in values.

She wan't on a highly addictive drug that rewired her brains pleasure centres.

She was a human being, and human beings enjoy socialisation. In the world we're fighting to work towards, human beings should not have to choose between a social life and a prosperous future. [The Grind is Not the glory]()
