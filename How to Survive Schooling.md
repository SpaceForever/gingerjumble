How to Survive Schooling

[[Ownership of Emotions]] (eg. [[Focus on What's in Your Control]])

In most classes, you have control over what you write. The teachers don't check your book very often, so you can scribble about any ideas you fancy as long as from a distance its believable that it is schoolwork. This is exceedingly convenient for me because I love writing, so I write out posts like crazy during lessons, making them very enjoyable and pass much quicker. So focus what's in your control! If you enjoy drawing, draw! If you enjoy writing, write! If you wish to turn your disatisfation with the school system into a cold resolve that in 5 years will bring it crumbling down to its evil knees, do so!
